<!-- <p>Thereupon Lord Not-real broke into a smile and said, &#8220;The spokesman for Chu has spoken in error, while the case for Qi leaves much to be desired. When the emperor demands that the feudal lords bear their tribute to his court, it is not that he desires the goods and articles they bring, but that his vassal may thereby &#8216;report on the administration of their offices&#8217;; and when he causes mounds to be raised on the
borders of states and their boundaries to be marked off, these are not for the purpose of
defence, but so that the feudal lords may not trespass upon each other&#8217;s lands. Now, although the king of Qi has been enfeoffed in the east to serve as a bastion to the imperial house, he is carrying on secret contacts with the Sushen and jeopardizing his own state by crossing his borders and sailing over the sea to hunt in the Green Hills, actions which are a violation of his duties. Both of you gentlemen, instead of attempting in your
discussions to make clear the duties of lord and subject and striving to rectify the behaviour of the feudal lords, vainly dispute with each other over the joys of hunting and the size of parks, each attempting to outdo the other in descriptions of lavish expenditures, each striving for supremacy in wanton delights. This is no way to win fame and gain praise, but will only blacken the names of your rulers and bring ruin to yourselves. Moreover, what do the states of Qi and Chu possess, that they are worth speaking about? You gentlemen perhaps have never laid eyes upon true splendour. Have you not heard of the Shanglin Park of the Son of Heaven? </p> -->
<h1>excerpt from <span style="font-style:italic">Shi Ji</span> 117: The Biography of Sima Xiangru</h1>
<h2>The Shanglin Park of the Son of Heaven</h2>
<br>
<p>&#8220;To the east of it lies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangwu" target="_blank" target="_blank">Cangwu</a>,</p>
<p>To the west the land of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiji_County" target="_blank" target="_blank">Xiji</a>;</p>

<p>On its south runs the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnabar" target="_blank" target="_blank">Cinnabar</a> River, </p>

<p>On its north, the Purple Deeps. </p>

<p>Within the park spring the Ba and Chan rivers, </p>

<p>And through it flow the Jing and Wei, </p>

<p>The Feng, the Hao, the Lao, and the Jue, </p>

<p>Twisting and turning their way </p>

<p>Through the reaches of the park; </p>

<p>Eight rivers, coursing onward, </p>

<p>Spreading in different directions, each with its own form. </p>

<p>North, south, east, and west </p>

<p>They race and tumble, </p>

<p>Pouring through the chasms of Pepper Hill, </p>

<p>Skirting the banks of the river islets, </p>

<p>Winding through the cinnamon forests </p>

<p>And across the broad meadows. </p>

<p>In wild confusion they swirl </p>

<p>Along the bases of the tall hills </p>

<p>And through the mouths of the narrow gorges; </p>

<p>Dashed upon boulders, maddened by winding escarpments, </p>

<p>They writhe in anger, </p>

<p>Leaping and curling upward, </p>

<p>Jostling and eddying in great swells </p>

<p>That surge and batter against each other; </p>

<p>Darting and twisting, </p>

<p>Foaming and tossing, </p>

<p>In a thundering chaos; </p>

<p>Arching into hills, billowing like clouds, </p>

<p>They dash to left and right, </p>

<p>Plunging and breaking in waves </p>

<p>That chatter over the shallows; </p>

<p>Crashing against the cliffs, pounding the embankments. </p>

<p>The waters pile up and reel back again, </p>

<p>Skipping across the rises, swooping into the hollows, </p>

<p>Rumbling and murmuring onward; </p>

<p>Deep and powerful, </p>

<p>Fierce and clamorous, </p>

<p>They froth and chum </p>

<p>Like the boiling waters of a cauldron, </p>

<p>Casting spray from their crests, until, </p>

<p>After their wild race through the gorges, </p>

<p>Their distant journey from afar, </p>

<p>They subside into silence, </p>

<p>Rolling on in peace to their long destination, </p>

<p>Boundless and without end, </p>

<p>Gliding in soundless and solemn procession, </p>

<p>Shimmering and shining in the sun, </p>

<p>To flow through giant lakes of the east </p>

<p>Or spill into the ponds along their banks. </p>

<p>Here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiulong" target="_blank">

</p>

<p>Arch their backs and twitch their tails, </p>

<p>Spread their scales and flap their fins, </p>

<p>Diving among the deep crevices; </p>

<p>The waters are loud with fish and turtles, </p>

<p>A multitude of living things. </p>

<p>Here moon-bright pearls </p>

<p>Gleam on the river slopes, </p>

<p>While <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz" target="_blank">

</p>

<p>And clear crystal in jumbled heaps </p>

<p>Glitter and sparkle, </p>

<p>Catching and throwing back a hundred colours </p>

<p>Where they lie tumbled on the river bottom. </p>

cormorants</a> </p>

<p>Flock and settle upon the waters, </p>

<p>Drifting lightly over the surface, </p>

<p>Buffeted by the wind, </p>

<p>Bobbing and dipping with the waves, </p>

<p>Sporting among the weedy banks, </p>

<p>Gobbling the reeds and <a

</p>

<p>Pecking at <a

chestnuts</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingdi_lotuses" target="_blank">
lotuses</a>. </p>

<p>Behind them rise the tall mountains, </p>

<p>Lofty crests lifted to the sky; </p>

<p>Clothed in dense forests of giant trees, </p>

<p>Jagged with peaks and crags; </p>

<p>The steep summits of the Nine Pikes, </p>

<p>The towering heights of the Southern Mountains, </p>

<p>Soar dizzily like a stack of cooking pots, </p>

<p>Precipitous and sheer. </p>

<p>Their sides are furrowed with ravines and valleys, </p>

<p>Narrow-mouthed clefts and open <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen" target="_blank">glens</a>,
</p>

<p>Through which rivulets dart and wind. </p>

<p>About their base, hills and islands </p>

<p>Raise their tall heads; </p>

<p>Ragged knolls and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillock" target="_blank">
hillocks</a> </p>

<p>Rise and fall, </p>

<p>Twisting and twining </p>

<p>Like the coiled bodies of reptiles; </p>

<p>While from their folds the mountain streams leap and tumble, </p>

<p>Spilling out upon the level plains. </p>

<p>There they flow a thousand miles along smooth beds, </p>

<p>Their banks lined with dikes </p>

<p>Blanketed with <a

<p>Breathing forth their fragrance, </p>

<p>Pungent and sweet, </p>

<p>A hundred perfumes </p>

<p>Wafted abroad </p>

<p>Upon the scented air. </p>

<p>Gazing about the expanse of the park </p>

<p>At the abundance and variety of its creatures, </p>

<p>One's eyes are dizzied and enraptured </p>

<p>By the boundless horizons, </p>

<p>The borderless vistas. </p>

<p>The sun rises from the eastern ponds </p>

<p>And sets among the slopes of the west; </p>

<p>In the southern part of the park, </p>

<p>Where grasses grow in the dead of winter </p>

</p>

<p>In the north, where in the midst of summer </p>

<p>The ground is cracked and blotched with ice </p>

<p>And one may walk the frozen streams or wade the rivulets, </p>

<p>Roam <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_unicorn" target="_blank">

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verandah" target="_blank">

<p>Interlacing paths for the royal <a

</p>

<p>And arcaded walks stretching such distances </p>

<p>That their length cannot be traversed in a single day. </p>

<p>Here the peaks have been levelled for mountain halls, </p>

<p>Terraces raised, storey upon storey, </p>

<p>And chambers built in the deep grottoes. </p>

<p>Peering down into the caves, one cannot spy their end; </p>

<p>Gazing up at the rafters, one seems to see them brush the heavens; </p>

<p>So lofty are the palaces that comets stream through their portals </p>

<p>And rainbows twine about their <a

</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Dragon" target="_blank">Green dragons</a> slither from the eastern pavilion; </p>

<p>Elephant-carved carriages prance from the pure hall of the west, </p>

<p>Bringing immortals to dine in the peaceful towers </p>

<p>And bands of fairies to sun themselves beneath the southern eaves. </p>

<p>Here sweet fountains bubble from clear chambers, </p>

<p>Racing in rivulets through the gardens, </p>

<p>Great stones lining their courses; </p>

<p>Plunging through caves and grottoes, </p>

<p>Clustered in dense copses, </p>

<p>Their limbs entwined, </p>

<p>Their foliage a thick curtain </p>

<p>Over stiff and bending trunks, </p>

<p>Their branches sweeping to the ground </p>

<p>Amidst a shower of falling petals. </p>

<p>They tremble and sigh </p>

<p>As they sway with the wind, </p>

<p>Creaking and moaning in the breeze </p>

<p>Like the tinkle of chimes </p>

<p>Or the wail of <a

</p>

<p>High and low they grow, </p>

<p>Screening the quarters of the palace ladies;
</p>

<p>A mass of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvan" target="_blank">
sylvan</a> darkness, </p>

<p>Blanketing the mountains and edging the valleys, </p>

<p>Ascending the slopes and dipping into the hollows, </p>

<p>As they leap nimbly to and fro, </p>

<p>Sporting among the limbs </p>

<p>And clambering haughtily to the treetops.
</p>

<p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Off they chase across bridgeless streams </p>

<p>And spring into the depths of a new grove, </p>

<p>Clutching the low-swinging branches, </p>

<p>Hurtling across the open spaces, </p>

<p>Racing and tumbling pell-mell, </p>

<p>Until they scatter from sight in the distance. </p>

<p>Such are the scenes of the imperial park, </p>

<p>A hundred, a thousand settings </p>

<p>To visit in the pursuit of pleasure; </p>

<p>Palaces, inns, villas, and lodges, </p>

<p>Each with its kitchens and pantries, </p>

<p>Its chambers of beautiful women </p>

<p>And staffs of officials. </p>

<p>Here, in late fall and early winter, </p>

<p>The Son of Heaven stakes his palisades and holds his hunts, </p>

<p>Mounted in a carriage of carved ivory </p>

<p>Drawn by six jade-spangled horses, sleek as dragons. </p>

<p>Rainbow pennants stream before him; </p>

<p>Cloud banners trail in the wind. </p>

<p>In the vanguard ride the hide-covered carriages
; </p>

<p>Behind, the carriages of his attendants.
</p>

<p>A coachman as clever as <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshu_Ao" target="_blank">Sun
Shu</a> grasps the reins; </p>

<p>A driver as skilful as the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Ling_of_Wei" target="_blank">Duke
of Wei</a> stands beside him. </p>

<p>His attendants fan out on all sides </p>

<p>As they move into the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisade" target="_blank">palisade</a>.
</p>

<p>They sound the sombre drums </p>

<p>And send the hunters to their posts; </p>

<p>They comer the quarry among the rivers </p>

<p>And spy them from the high hills. </p>

<p>Then the carriages and horsemen thunder forth, </p>

<p>Startling the heavens, shaking the earth;
</p>

<p>Van guard and rear dash in different directions, </p>

<p>Scattering after the prey. </p>

<p>On they race in droves, </p>

<p>Rounding the hills, streaming across the lowlands, </p>

<p>Like enveloping clouds or drenching rain. </p>

<p>Leopards and panthers they take alive;
</p>

<p>They strike down jackals and wolves. </p>

<p>With their hands they seize the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_black_bear" target="_blank">black
and tawny bears</a>, </p>

<p>And with their feet they down the wild sheep. </p>

<p>Wearing pheasant-tailed caps </p>

<p>And breeches of white tiger skin </p>

<p>Under patterned tunics, </p>

<p>They sit astride their wild horses; </p>

<p>They clamber up the steep slopes of the Three Pikes </p>

<p>And descend again to the river shoals, </p>

<p>Galloping over the hillsides and the narrow passes, </p>

<p>Through the valleys and across the rivers.
</p>

<p>They fell the 'dragon sparrows' </p>

<p>And sport with the xiezhi, </p>

<p>Strike the xiage </p>

<p>And with short spears stab the little bears, </p>

<p>Snare the fabulous yaoniao horses </p>

<p>And shoot down the great boars. </p>

<p>No arrow strikes the prey </p>

<p>Without piercing a neck or shattering a skull; </p>

<p>No bow is discharged in vain, </p>

<p>But to the sound of each twang some beast must fall. </p>

<p>Then the imperial carriage signals to slacken pace </p>

<p>While the emperor wheels this way and that, </p>

<p>Gazing afar at the progress of the hunting bands, </p>

<p>Noting the disposition of their leaders. </p>

<p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>At a sign, the Son of Heaven and his men resume their pace, </p>

<p>Swooping off again across the distant plains. </p>

<p>They bear down upon the soaring birds;
</p>

<p>Their carriage wheels crush the wily beast. </p>

<p>Their axles strike the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer#White_deer" target="_blank">white
deer</a>; </p>

<p>Deftly they snatch the fleeting <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_hare" target="_blank">hares</a>
; </p>

<p>Swifter than a flash </p>

<p>Of scarlet lightning, </p>

<p>They pursue strange creatures </p>

<p>Beyond the borders of heaven. </p>

<p>To bows like the famous Fanruo </p>

<p>They fit their white-feathered arrows, </p>

<p>To shoot the fleeing goblin-birds </p>

<p>And strike down the griffins. </p>

<p>For their mark they choose the fattest game </p>

<p>And name their prey before they shoot. </p>

<p>No sooner has an arrow left the string </p>

<p>Then the quarry topples to the ground. </p>

<p>Again the signal is raised and they soar aloft, </p>

<p>Sweeping upward upon the gale, </p>

<p>Rising with the whirlwind, </p>

<p>Borne upon the void, </p>

<p>The companions of gods, </p>

<p>To trample upon the black crane </p>

<p>And scatter the flocks of giant pheasants, </p>

<p>Swoop down upon the peacocks </p>

<p>And the golden roc, </p>

<p>Drive aside the five-coloured yi bird </p>

<p>And down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenghuang" target="_blank">
phoenixes</a>, </p>

<p>Snatch the storks of heaven </p>

<p>And the birds of darkness, </p>

<p>Until, exhausting the paths of the sky, </p>

<p>They wheel their carriages and return. </p>

<p>Roaming as the spirit moves them, </p>

<p>Descending to earth in a far corner of the north, </p>

<p>Swift and straight is their course </p>

<p>As they hasten home again. </p>

<p>Then the emperor ascends the Stone Gate </p>

<p>And visits the Great Peak Tower, </p>

<p>Stops at the Magpie Turret </p>

<p>And gazes afar from the Dew Cold Observatory, </p>

<p>Descends to the Wild Plum Palace </p>

<p>And takes his ease in the Palace of Righteous Spring; </p>

<p>To the west he hastens to the Xuanqu Palace </p>

<p>And poles in a pelican boat over Ox Head Lake. </p>

<p>He climbs the Dragon Terrace </p>

<p>And rests in the Tower of Lithe Willows, </p>

<p>Weighing the effort and skill of his attendants </p>

<p>And calculating the catch made by his huntsmen. </p>

<p>He examines the beasts struck down by the carriages, </p>

<p>Those trampled beneath the feet of the horsemen </p>

<p>And trod upon by the beaters; </p>

<p>Those which, from sheer exhaustion </p>

<p>Or the pangs of overwhelming terror, </p>

<p>Fell dead without a single wound, </p>

<p>Where they lie, heaped in confusion, </p>

<p>Tumbled in the gullies and filling the hollows, </p>

<p>Covering the plains and strewn about the swamps. </p>

<p>Then, wearied of the chase, </p>

<p>He orders wine brought forth on the Terrace of Azure Heaven </p>

<p>And music for the still and spacious halls.
</p>

<p>His courtiers, sounding the massive bells </p>

<p>That swing from the giant bell rack, </p>

<p>Raising the pennants of kingfisher feathers, </p>

<p>And setting up the drum of sacred lizard skin, </p>

<p>Present for his pleasure the dances of Yao </p>

<p>And the songs of the ancient Emperor Ge; </p>

<p>A thousand voices intone, </p>

<p>Ten thousand join in harmony, </p>

<p>As the mountains and hills rock with echoes </p>

<p>And the valley waters quiver to the sound. </p>

<p>The dances of Bayu, of Song and Cai, </p>

<p>The Yuzhe song of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huainan" target="_blank">
Huainan</a>, </p>

<p>The airs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dian_Kingdom" target="_blank">
Dian</a> and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wencheng_County" target="_blank">Wencheng</a>,
</p>

<p>One after another in groups they perform, </p>

<p>Sounding in succession the gongs and drums </p>

<p>Whose shrill clash and dull booming </p>

<p>Pierce the heart and startle the ear. </p>

<p>The tunes Jing, Wu, Zheng, and Wei, </p>

<p>The Shao, Huo, Wu, and Xiang music, </p>

<p>And amorous and carefree ditties </p>

<p>Mingle with the songs of Yan and Ying, </p>

<p>'Onward Chu!' and 'The Gripping Wind'. </p>

<p>Then come actors, musicians and trained dwarfs, </p>

<p>And singing girls from the land of Didi, </p>

<p>To delight the ear and eye </p>

<p>And bring mirth to the mind; </p>

<p>On all sides a torrent of gorgeous sounds, </p>

<p>A pageant of enchanting colour. </p>

<p>Here are maidens to match </p>

<p>The goddesses Blue Lute and Princess Fu: </p>

<p>Creatures of matchless beauty, </p>

<p>Seductive and fair, </p>

<p>With painted faces and carved hairpins, </p>

<p>Fragile and full of grace, </p>

<p>Lithe and supple, </p>

<p>Of delicate feature and form, </p>

<p>Trailing cloaks of sheerest silk </p>

<p>And long robes that seem as though carved and painted, </p>

<p>Swirling and fluttering about them </p>

<p>Like magic garments; </p>

<p>With them wafts a cloud of scent, </p>

<p>A delicious perfume; </p>

<p>White teeth sparkle </p>

<p>In engaging smiles, </p>

<p>Eyebrows arch delicately, </p>

<p>Eyes cast darting glances, </p>

<p>Until their beauty has seized the soul of the beholder </p>

<p>And his heart in joy hastens to their side. </p>

<p>"But then, when the wine has flowed freely and the merriment is at its height, the Son of Heaven becomes lost in contemplation, like one whose spirit has wandered, and he cries, &#8216Alas! What is this but a wasteful extravagance? Now that I have found a moment of leisure from the affairs of state, I thought it a shame to cast away the days in idleness and so, in this autumn season, when Heaven itself slays life, I have joined in its slaughter and come to this hunting park to take my ease. And yet I fear that those who follow me in ages to come may grow infatuated with these sports, until they lose themselves in the pursuit of pleasure and forget to return again to their duties. Surely this is no way for one who has inherited the throne to carry on the great task of his forbears and insure the rule of our imperial house!&#8217</p>

<p>"Then he dismisses the revellers, sends away the huntsmen, and instructs his ministers, saying, &#8216If there are lands here in these suburbs that can be opened for cultivation, let them all be turned into farms in order that my people may receive aid and benefit thereby. Tear down the walls and fill up the moats, that the common folk may come and profit from these hills and lowlands! Stock the lakes with fish and do not prohibit men from taking them! Empty the palaces and towers, and let them no longer be staffed! Open the storehouses and granaries to succour the poor and starving and help those who are in want; pity the widower and widow, protect the orphans and those without families! I would broadcast the name of virtue and lessen punishments and fines; alter the measurements and statutes, change the colour of the vestments, reform the calendar and, with all men under heaven, make a new beginning!&#8217 </p>

<p>&#8220;Then, selecting an auspicious day and fasting in preparation, </p>

<p>He dons his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_robe" target="_blank">
court robes</a> </p>

<p>And mounts the carriage of state, </p>

<p>With its flowery pennants flying </p>

<p>And its jade bells ringing. </p>

<p>He sports now in the Park of the Six Arts, </p>

<p>Races upon the Road of Benevolence and Righteousness, </p>

<p>And scans the Forest of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Annals" target="_blank">
Spring and Autumn Annals</a>. </p>

<p>His archery now is to the stately measures of &#8216;The Fox Head&#8217;</p>

<p>And &#8216;The Beast of Virtue&#8217;;</p>

<p>His prey is the Dance of the Black Cranes, </p>

<p>Casting the heavenly Cloud Net, </p>

<p>He snares the songs of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Poetry" target="_blank">Book
of Odes</a>, </p>

<p>Sighs over &#8216;The Felling of the Sandalwood&#8217; </p>

<p>And delights in the ruler who &#8216;shares his joy with all&#8217;.</p>

<p>And wanders in the orchard of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_documents" target="_blank">Book
of Documents</a>. </p>

<p>He spreads the teachings of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching" target="_blank">Book of Changes</a>, </p>

<p>Sets free the strange beasts penned in his park, </p>

<p>Ascends the Bright Hall, </p>

<p>And seats himself in the Temple of the Ancestors. </p>

<p>&#8220;Then may his ministers freely present before him their proposals for the betterment of the empire, and within the four seas there is no one who does not share in the 'spoils' of this new hunt. Then is the empire filled with great joy; all men turn their faces toward the wind of imperial virtue and harken to its sound. As though borne upon a stream, they are transformed to goodness; with shouts of gladness they set forth upon the <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao" target="_blank">Way</a> and journey to   righteousness, so that harsh punishments are set aside and no longer used. Finer is this ruler's virtue than that of the Three Sages of antiquity, more plenteous his merits than those of the Five Emperors. When a ruler has achieved such virtue, then may he enjoy himself at the hunt without incurring blame. But to gallop from morn to night in sunshine or rain, exhausting the spirit and tiring the body, wearing out the carriages and horses, draining the energies of the huntsmen and squandering the resources of the treasury; to think only of one's own pleasure before sufficient benefits have been bestowed upon others; to ignore the common people and neglect the government of the nation, merely because one is greedy for a catch of pheasants and hares - this no truly benevolent ruler would do! Thus, from what I can see, the kings of Qi and Chu merit only pity. Though their domains are no more than a thousand li square, their hunting parks occupy nine tenths of the area, so that the land cannot be cleared and the people have no space to grow food. When one who is no more than a feudal prince attempts to indulge in extravagances fit only for the supreme ruler, then I fear it is the common people who will suffer in the end!&#8221; </p>

<p>At these words Sir Fantasy and Master No-such abruptly changed countenance and looked uneasily about, quite at a loss for words. Then, backing off and rising from their places, they replied, &#8220;We are uncouth and ignorant men who do not know when to hold our tongues. Fortunately today we have received your instruction, and we shall do our best to abide by it.&#8221; </p>
