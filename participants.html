    		<h1>Scheduling</h1>
    		<p>Sign up for any two-hour block available <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUxValBVLTRadWotfGRlZmF1bHR8ZTkyNGRhNGIwNTZlZDEwZmQ5N2U1N2VhN2FjOThiZmM">here</a>! The experiment should only take 90 minutes, but I schedule two hours to be conservative. When your day and time comes, just show up at <strong>Psych 138</strong> (at the east end of the long hall in the psych building, to the right if you enter from the doors facing the parking lot)!</p>
			<h1>What to Expect</h1>
			<p>You&#8217;ll arrive and review/sign a consent form. Then you&#8217;ll receive an eye exam to test for your normal or corrected-to-normal vision. I&#8217;ll set you up in the EEG cap -- the longest part of the experiment at roughly 60 minutes -- during which I&#8217;ll put gel on your scalp at 96 electrode sites and use a wooden q-tip to push the the gel down, move your hair aside, and remove dead skin cells. You&#8217;re welcome to bring reading material for the setup!</p>
			<p>Once the cap is set up, you&#8217;ll spend about 8 minutes performing a simple computer task indicating which direction the center of a group of arrows is facing. Two cash awards will go to the fastest and most accurate participants!</p>
			<h1>Some Tips</h1>
			<p>It isn&#8217;t necessary, but it&#8217;s probably a good idea to get a good night&#8217;s sleep beforehand. When you&#8217;re tired, you may have a harder time with the tasks and the stillness required during them, and your neural activity may be noisier.</p>
			<p>While you can wear either contacts or glasses, we ask participants to refrain from blinking as much as possible during the experiment, and this appears to be more difficult while wearing contacts.</p>
			<p>It&#8217;s best for the experiment for you to have recently washed your hair because the dead skin cells that hang out on the scalp can interfere with the signal we're trying to pick up, which can lead to a longer experimental setup time.</p>
			<p>Though the experiment is scheduled to be two hours, you&#8217;ll not want to schedule anything just after it so you have time to wash electrode gel from your hair (which you&#8217;ll be able to do at home or in the lab -- we provide shampoo, conditioner, and clean towels).</p>
			<h1>Thank you.</h1>
			<p>I need a minimum sample size of 42 participants -- whose data are usable -- for this experiment to be able to reach power. Each one of you will make an enormous difference.
