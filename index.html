      <p>I said I will find what is lowly<br>and put the roots of my identity
	<br>down there:
	<br>each day I&#x92;ll wake up
	<br>and find the lowly nearby,
	<br>a handy focus and reminder,
	<br>a ready measure of my significance,
	<br>the voice by which I would be heard,
	<br>the wills, the kinds of selfishness
	<br>I could
	<br>freely adopt as my own:
	<br>
	<br>but though I have looked everywhere,
	<br>I can find nothing
	<br>to give myself to:
	<br>everything is
	<br>
	<br>magnificent with existence, is in
	<br>surfeit of glory:
	<br>nothing is diminished,
	<br>nothing has been diminished for me:</p>
