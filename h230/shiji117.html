<p>When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_(state)"Chu</a> dispatched Sir Fantasy as its envoy to then<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(state)">state of Qi</a>, the
king of Qi called out all the knights within his domain and, providing the party with carriages and horsemen, went out with the envoy on a hunt. After the hunt was over, Sir Fantasy was describing the wonders of the event to Master No-such, while Lord Not-real stood by.

replied Sir
Fantasy. "Did

large catch?" Master
No-such asked,

the catch was rather meagre." "If the catch was small, then what did
you find so enjoyable?" he pressed. "What I

endeavouring to impress me
with the great number of carriages and horsemen, while for my part I described
to him the hunts which we have at <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunmeng_County">Yunmeng</a>
in Chu." "Would you perhaps tell us about these hunts of Qi and
Chu?" asked Master No-such, to which Sir Fantasy replied: </p>

<p>"Surely! </p>

<p>The king of Qi rode forth with a thousand carriages, </p>

<p>Selecting to accompany him ten thousand horsemen, </p>

<p>To hunt on the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Sea">borders
of the sea</a>. </p>

<p>The ranks of men filled the lowlands; </p>

<p>Their nets and snares covered the hills. </p>

<p>They seized the <a
href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41286/0">hares</a>
and ran down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_deer">
deer</a>, </p>

<p>Shot

> arrows
> and
snared the
> feet
> of
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qilin"> style='color:
#1155CC'>unicorns</a>. </p>

<p>They raced along the briny coves, </p>

<p>The new-felled game staining their carriage
wheels. </p>

<p>Their arrows found their mark and the catch was plentiful
; </p>

<p>The king grew proud and began to boast of his achievements. </p>

<p>He turned in his carriage and said to me, </p>

<p>" 'Does the state of Chu also have its hunting lands, its
wide plains and stretching lowlands, as rich and joyous as these? Can the hunts
of the king of Chu rival these of mine?' </p>

<p>"I dismounted from my carriage and replied, 'I am only a
humble inhabitant of the land of Chu. I have served the king ten years or more,
and at times have accompanied him on his travels; I have attended him in the
hunting parks of the capital of Chu and seen in person what they are like; yet
I have not seen all by any means, and I can hardly speak of his hunts in the
distant low lands.' </p>

<p>" 'Be that as it may,' said the king of Qi, 'tell me in
general what you have seen and heard!' and I replied, 'Of course, of
course." </p>

<p>'In Chu,
they say, there
> are seven
> lowlands.
> Of these I
> have visited only one; the other
six I have never seen. The one I have visited is the smallest of them all,
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunmeng_County">
Yunmeng</a>. It is nine hundred <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_(unit)">li</a>
square, and in the centre there is a mountain. </p>

<p>" 'A mountain
which winds and twists upward, </p>

<p>Rearing its lofty crags on high, </p>

<p>Covered with ragged jutting peaks </p>

<p>That blot out the sun and moon </p>

<p>And entangle them in their folds; </p>

<p>Its crest pierces the blue clouds, </p>

<p>The king of Chu orders his brave warriors </p>

<p>To seize these beasts with their bare hands, </p>

<p>While he mounts behind four <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piebald">piebald
horses</a>, </p>

<p>Riding in a <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/camaron_m/6794151837/">
carriage of carved jade</a>. </p>

<p>From pliant staffs of whalebone </p>

<p>Stream banners studded with moon-bright pearls. </p>

<p>He grasps his stout lance forged by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gan_Jiang_and_Mo_Ye"> style='color:
#1155CC'>Gan Jiang</a>. </p>

<p>At his left side hangs the painted bow of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Emperor">Yellow
Emperor</a>; </p>

<p>On his right are strong arrows in a quiver of the Xia kings. </p>

<p>A companion as wise as <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Xiong_(author)"> style='color:
#1155CC'>Yangzi</a> of old stands by his side; </p>

<p>A driver as skilled as <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Xian_of_Han"> style='color:
#1155CC'>Xian'a</a> holds the reins. </p>

<p>Though the steeds are reined in to an easy pace, </p>

<p>They gain on the wily beasts; </p>

<p>The carriage wheels run down asses, </p>

<p>The steeds kick at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onager">
onagers</a>, </p>

<p>Spears pierce wild horses, axle points cut down wild mares, </p>

<p>As
the hunters
> behind
> their
> powerful
> steeds
> shoot at fleeing jackasses. </p>

<p>Swiftly, relentlessly, </p>

<p>Like thunder they move, like the whirlwind they advance, </p>

<p>Streaming like comets, striking like lightning. </p>

<p>No shot leaves their bows in vain </p>

<p>But each must pierce the eye of the game, </p>

<p>Burrow in the breast, strike through the side, </p>

<p>And sever the cords of the heart, </p>

<p>Till the catch becomes a rain of beasts, </p>

<p>Covering the grass and filling the ground.
</p>

<p>With this the king of Chu slackens his pace and gazes about, </p>

<p>Raising his head with lofty composure;
</p>

<p>He looks toward the dark forest, </p>

<p>Observes the fierceness of his brave huntsmen </p>

<p>And the terror of the wild beasts, </p>

<p>Then spurs after the exhausted game, striking those that are
spent, </p>

<p>Watching the aspect of every creature. </p>

<p>Next come the lovely maidens and fair princesses, </p>

<p>Robed in fine silk cloth </p>

<p>And trailing rich silks and crepes, </p>

<p>Girdled in sheer netting </p>

<p>And draped with scarves like mist, </p>

<p>Beneath
which their skirts, gathered in close pleats, </p>

<p>Gently swirl and sway, </p>

<p>Falling in deep and pliant folds, </p>

<p>So long and full </p>

<p>That they must gather up the hems demurely. </p>

<p>With flying beads and dangling pendants,</p>

<p>They bend and sway in their carriages, </p>

<p>Their robes and scarves rustling softly, </p>

<p>Brushing the heads of the orchids below </p>

<p>Or fluttering against the feathered carriage tops, </p>

<p>Tangling in their <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kingfisher+hairpinhl=ensafe=offtbo=utbm=ischsource=univsa=Xei=gta7UIutEYG1iwK-yYDoDgved=0CDEQsAQbiw=831bih=628">
kingfisher hairpins</a> </p>

<p>Or twining about the jewelled carriage cords.
</p>

<p>Lightly and nimbly they come </p>

<p>Like a vision of goddesses. </p>

<p>Together the groups set out to hunt in the fields of <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=marsh+orchid+chinahl=ensafe=offtbo=utbm=ischsource=univsa=Xei=rda7UNzwJKvliwLmqoCIBAved=0CC4QsAQbiw=831bih=628">
marsh orchids</a>; </p>

<p>Scrambling through the thick grasses </p>

<p>And ascending the stout embankments of the river, </p>

<p>They surprise <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingfisher">
kingfishers</a> </p>

<p>And shoot crow pheasants, </p>

<p>Fix fine cords </p>

<p>To their short arrows </p>

<p>To shoot the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_geese">
white geese</a> </p>

<p>And the wild swans, </p>

<p>Bring down a pair of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Egret">egrets</a>
</p>

<p>Or a<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-necked_Crane">
black crane</a>. </p>

<p>Tiring of these sports, they embark </p>

<p>To sail upon the clear lake, </p>

<p>And drift over the surface in their pelican-prowed boats. </p>

<p>They lift their cassia oars, </p>

<p>Spread kingfisher curtains, </p>

<p>And raise feathered canopies; </p>

<p>With nets they snare terrapins </p>

<p>And angle for <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gari_stangeri">purple
molluscs</a>; </p>

<p>They strike golden drums </p>

<p>And sound the wailing flutes, </p>

<p>As the songs of the boatmen </p>

<p>Echo across the water. </p>

<p>The lake insects are startled </p>

<p>By the waves of their wake, </p>

<p>As the bubbling springs gush forth, </p>

<p>A turmoil of water, </p>

<p>And the boulders in the depths grate together </p>

<p>With a dull, reverberating roar </p>

<p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Like the voice of thunder </p>

<p>Resounding a hundred miles. </p>

<p>To signal the huntsmen to rest from their labours, </p>

<p>The sacred drums are sounded </p>

<p>And beacon fires raised; </p>

<p>The carriages draw up in ranks, </p>

<p>The horsemen form in battalions, </p>

<p>And all take their places in proper order, </p>

<p>Range themselves once more in
position. </p>

<p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Then the king of Chu ascends the Terrace of the Bright Clouds, </p>

<p>Where he rests in perfect repose, </p>

<p>Takes his leisure in perfect ease </p>

<p>And, flavouring his dishes with herbs and spices, </p>

<p>Sits down to feast. </p>

<p>The king of Chu is not like Your Highness, </p>

<p>Who counts it a pleasure to race all day,
</p>

<p>Never descending from your carriage to rest, </p>

<p>Slashing at game and staining your carriage
wheels with blood. </p>

<p>If I may speak from what I have seen, </p>

<p>The hunts of Qi cannot match those of Chu!' " </p>

<p>"With this the king of Qi fell silent and did not answer
me." </p>

<p>"How can you speak in such error?" exclaimed Master
No-such. </p>

<p>"You have not considered a thousand miles too long a

> By speaking as

invite contempt from the king of Qi and cause embarrassment to the state of
Chu. </p>

<p>"As for Qi, it is bounded on the east by the vast ocean, </p>

<p>And on the south by the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Langya">mountains
of Langya</a>. </p>

<p>We may take our pleasure upon Mt. Cheng </p>

<p>And shoot game on the slopes of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhifu_Island">Zhifu</a>,
</p>

<p>Sail upon the <a
href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/465549/Bo-Hai">
Gulf of Bohai</a> </p>

<p>And roam the marsh of Mengzhu. </p>

<p>Northeast of us lies the land of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushen">Sushen</a>,
</p>

<p>And east of this we border the Valley of Boiling Water. </p>

<p>In autumn we hunt in the region of the Green Hills, </p>

<p>Sailing far away over the seas; </p>

<p>Our state could swallow eight or nine of your Yunmengs </p>

<p>And they would never even tickle its throat. </p>

<p>As for the wonders and marvels you speak of, </p>

<p>The strange creatures of other regions, </p>

<p>The rare beasts and odd birds -</p>

<p>All manner of beings are gathered here in Qi </p>

<p>In such abundance within our borders </p>

<p>That I could not finish describing them, </p>

<p>Nor could the ancient sage <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great">Emperor
Yu</a> give them names </p>

<p>Or his minister Xie write them all
down. </p>

<p>Yet, since the king of Qi is but a vassal of the emperor, </p>

<p>He does not consider it right to speak of the joys of travel </p>

<p>Or describe the magnificence of his parks and gardens. </p>

<p>Moreover, you are here as his guest, </p>

<p>And this is why he declined to reply to your words. </p>

<p>How could you think it was because he had no answer?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>Thereupon
> Lord
> Not-real
> broke
> into
> a
smile arid

> "The spokesman for Chu has spoken
in error, while the case for Qi leaves much to be desired. When the emperor
demands that the feudal lords bear their tribute to his court, 
it is

that his

defence, but so that the feudal lords may not trespass upon each other's lands.
Now, although the king of Qi has been enfeoffed in the east to serve as a
bastion to the imperial house, he is carrying on secret contacts with the
Sushen and jeopardizing his own state by crossing his borders and sailing over
the sea to hunt in the Green Hills, actions which are
a violation of his duties. Both of you gentlemen, instead of attempting in your
discussions to make clear the duties of lord and subject and striving to
rectify the behaviour of the feudal
> lords, 
>vainly
> dispute with each other over the joys of
hunting and the size of parks, each attempting to outdo the other in
descriptions of lavish
expenditures, each striving for supremacy
> in wanton delights. This is no way to
win fame and gain praise, but will only blacken the names of your 
rulers and bring
ruin to yourselves. Moreover, what do the states of Qi and Chu possess, that
they are worth speaking about? You gentlemen perhaps have never laid eyes upon
true splendour. Have you not heard of the Shanglin Park of the Son of Heaven? </p>

<p>"To the east of it lies <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangwu">Cangwu</a>,
</p>

<p>To the west the land of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiji_County">Xiji</a>;
</p>

<p>On its south runs the Cinnabar River, </p>

<p>On its north, the Purple Deeps. </p>

<p>Within the park spring the Ba and Chan rivers, </p>

<p>And through it flow the Jing and Wei, </p>

<p>The Feng, the Hao, the Lao, and the Jue, </p>

<p>Twisting and turning their way </p>

<p>Through the reaches of the park; </p>

<p>Eight rivers, coursing onward, </p>

<p>Spreading in different directions, each with its own form. </p>

<p>North, south, east, and west </p>

<p>They race and tumble, </p>

<p>Pouring through the chasms of Pepper Hill, </p>

<p>Skirting the banks of the river islets, </p>

<p>Winding through the cinnamon forests </p>

<p>And across the broad meadows. </p>

<p>In wild confusion they swirl </p>

<p>Along the bases of the tall hills </p>

<p>And through the mouths of the narrow gorges; </p>

<p>Dashed upon boulders, maddened by winding escarpments, </p>

<p>They writhe in anger, </p>

<p>Leaping and curling upward, </p>

<p>Jostling and eddying in great swells </p>

<p>That surge and batter against each other; </p>

<p>Darting and twisting, </p>

<p>Foaming and tossing, </p>

<p>In a thundering chaos; </p>

<p>Arching into hills, billowing like clouds, </p>

<p>They dash to left and right, </p>

<p>Plunging and breaking in waves </p>

<p>That chatter over the shallows; </p>

<p>Crashing against the cliffs, pounding the embankments. </p>

<p>The waters pile up and reel back again, </p>

<p>Skipping across the rises, swooping into the hollows, </p>

<p>Rumbling and murmuring onward; </p>

<p>Deep and powerful, </p>

<p>Fierce and clamorous, </p>

<p>They froth and chum </p>

<p>Like the boiling waters of a cauldron, </p>

<p>Casting spray from their crests, until, </p>

<p>After their wild race through the gorges, </p>

<p>Their distant journey from afar, </p>

<p>They subside into silence, </p>

<p>Rolling on in peace to their long destination, </p>

<p>Boundless and without end, </p>

<p>Gliding in soundless and solemn procession, </p>

<p>Shimmering and shining in the sun, </p>

<p>To flow through giant lakes of the east </p>

<p>Or spill into the ponds along their banks. </p>

<p>Off they chase across bridgeless streams </p>

<p>And spring into the depths of a new grove, </p>

<p>Clutching the low-swinging branches, </p>

<p>Hurtling across the open spaces, </p>

<p>Racing and tumbling pell-mell, </p>

<p>Until they scatter from sight in the distance. </p>

<p>Such are the scenes of the imperial park, </p>

<p>A hundred, a thousand settings </p>

<p>To visit in the pursuit of pleasure; </p>

<p>Palaces, inns, villas, and lodges, </p>

<p>Each with its kitchens and pantries, </p>

<p>Its chambers of beautiful women </p>

<p>And staffs of officials. </p>

<p>Here, in late fall and early winter, </p>

<p>The Son of Heaven stakes his palisades and holds his hunts, </p>

<p>Mounted in a carriage of carved ivory </p>

<p>Drawn by six jade-spangled horses, sleek as dragons. </p>

<p>Rainbow pennants stream before him; </p>

<p>Cloud banners trail in the wind. </p>

<p>In the vanguard ride the hide-covered carriages
; </p>

<p>Behind, the carriages of his attendants.
</p>

<p>A coachman as clever as <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshu_Ao">Sun
Shu</a> grasps the reins; </p>

<p>A driver as skilful as the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Ling_of_Wei">Duke
of Wei</a> stands beside him. </p>

<p>His attendants fan out on all sides </p>

<p>As they move into the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisade">palisade</a>.
</p>

<p>They sound the sombre drums </p>

<p>And send the hunters to their posts; </p>

<p>They comer the quarry among the rivers </p>

<p>And spy them from the high hills. </p>

<p>Then the carriages and horsemen thunder forth, </p>

<p>Startling the heavens, shaking the earth;
</p>

<p>Van guard and rear dash in different directions, </p>

<p>Scattering after the prey. </p>

<p>On they race in droves, </p>

<p>Rounding the hills, streaming across the lowlands, </p>

<p>Like enveloping clouds or drenching rain. </p>

<p>Leopards and panthers they take alive;
</p>

<p>They strike down jackals and wolves. </p>

<p>With their hands they seize the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_black_bear">black
and tawny bears</a>, </p>

<p>And with their feet they down the wild sheep. </p>

<p>Wearing pheasant-tailed caps </p>

<p>And breeches of white tiger skin </p>

<p>Under patterned tunics, </p>

<p>They sit astride their wild horses; </p>

<p>They clamber up the steep slopes of the Three Pikes </p>

<p>And descend again to the river shoals, </p>

<p>Galloping over the hillsides and the narrow passes, </p>

<p>Through the valleys and across the rivers.
</p>

<p>They fell the 'dragon sparrows' </p>

<p>And sport with the xiezhi, </p>

<p>Strike the xiage </p>

<p>And with short spears stab the little bears, </p>

<p>Snare the fabulous yaoniao horses </p>

<p>And shoot down the great boars. </p>

<p>No arrow strikes the prey </p>

<p>Without piercing a neck or shattering a skull; </p>

<p>No bow is discharged in vain, </p>

<p>But to the sound of each twang some beast must fall. </p>

<p>Then the imperial carriage signals to slacken pace </p>

<p>While the emperor wheels this way and that, </p>

<p>Gazing afar at the progress of the hunting bands, </p>

<p>Noting the disposition of their leaders. </p>

<p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>At a sign, the Son of Heaven and his men resume their pace, </p>

<p>Swooping off again across the distant plains. </p>

<p>They bear down upon the soaring birds;
</p>

<p>Their carriage wheels crush the wily beast. </p>

<p>Their axles strike the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer#White_deer">white
deer</a>; </p>

<p>Deftly they snatch the fleeting <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_hare">hares</a>
; </p>

<p>Swifter than a flash </p>

<p>Of scarlet lightning, </p>

<p>They pursue strange creatures </p>

<p>Beyond the borders of heaven. </p>

<p>To bows like the famous Fanruo </p>

<p>They fit their white-feathered arrows, </p>

<p>To shoot the fleeing goblin-birds </p>

<p>And strike down the griffins. </p>

<p>For their mark they choose the fattest game </p>

<p>And name their prey before they shoot. </p>

<p>No sooner has an arrow left the string </p>

<p>Then the quarry topples to the ground. </p>

<p>Again the signal is raised and they soar aloft, </p>

<p>Sweeping upward upon the gale, </p>

<p>Rising with the whirlwind, </p>

<p>Borne upon the void, </p>

<p>The companions of gods, </p>

<p>To trample upon the black crane </p>

<p>And scatter the flocks of giant pheasants, </p>

<p>Swoop down upon the peacocks </p>

<p>And the golden roc, </p>

<p>Drive aside the five-coloured yi bird </p>

<p>And down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenghuang">
phoenixes</a>, </p>

<p>Snatch the storks of heaven </p>

<p>And the birds of darkness, </p>

<p>Until, exhausting the paths of the sky, </p>

<p>They wheel their carriages and return. </p>

<p>Roaming as the spirit moves them, </p>

<p>Descending to earth in a far corner of the north, </p>

<p>Swift and straight is their course </p>

<p>As they hasten home again. </p>

<p>Then the emperor ascends the Stone Gate </p>

<p>And visits the Great Peak Tower, </p>

<p>Stops at the Magpie Turret </p>

<p>And gazes afar from the Dew Cold Observatory, </p>

<p>Descends to the Wild Plum Palace </p>

<p>And takes his ease in the Palace of Righteous Spring; </p>

<p>To the west he hastens to the Xuanqu Palace </p>

<p>And poles in a pelican boat over Ox Head Lake. </p>

<p>He climbs the Dragon Terrace </p>

<p>And rests in the Tower of Lithe Willows, </p>

<p>Weighing the effort and skill of his attendants </p>

<p>And calculating the catch made by his huntsmen. </p>

<p>He examines the beasts struck down by the carriages, </p>

<p>Those trampled beneath the feet of the horsemen </p>

<p>And trod upon by the beaters; </p>

<p>Those which, from sheer exhaustion </p>

<p>Or the pangs of overwhelming terror, </p>

<p>Fell dead without a single wound, </p>

<p>Where they lie, heaped in confusion, </p>

<p>Tumbled in the gullies and filling the hollows, </p>

<p>Covering the plains and strewn about the swamps. </p>

<p>Then, wearied of the chase, </p>

<p>He orders wine brought forth on the Terrace of Azure Heaven </p>

<p>And music for the still and spacious halls.
</p>

<p>His courtiers, sounding the massive bells </p>

<p>That swing from the giant bell rack, </p>

<p>Raising the pennants of kingfisher feathers, </p>

<p>And setting up the drum of sacred lizard skin, </p>

<p>Present for his pleasure the dances of Yao </p>

<p>And the songs of the ancient Emperor Ge; </p>

<p>A thousand voices intone, </p>

<p>Ten thousand join in harmony, </p>

<p>As the mountains and hills rock with echoes </p>

<p>And the valley waters quiver to the sound. </p>

<p>The dances of Bayu, of Song and Cai, </p>

<p>The Yuzhe song of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huainan">
Huainan</a>, </p>

<p>The airs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dian_Kingdom">
Dian</a> and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wencheng_County">Wencheng</a>,
</p>

<p>One after another in groups they perform, </p>

<p>Sounding in succession the gongs and drums </p>

<p>Whose shrill clash and dull booming </p>

<p>Pierce the heart and startle the ear. </p>

<p>The tunes Jing, Wu, Zheng, and Wei, </p>

<p>The Shao, Huo, Wu, and Xiang music, </p>

<p>And amorous and carefree ditties </p>

<p>Mingle with the songs of Yan and Ying, </p>

<p>'Onward Chu!' and 'The Gripping Wind'. </p>

<p>Then come actors, musicians and trained dwarfs, </p>

<p>And singing girls from the land of Didi, </p>

<p>To delight the ear and eye </p>

<p>And bring mirth to the mind; </p>

<p>On all sides a torrent of gorgeous sounds, </p>

<p>A pageant of enchanting colour. </p>

<p>Here are maidens to match </p>

<p>The goddesses Blue Lute and Princess Fu: </p>

<p>Creatures of matchless beauty, </p>

<p>Seductive and fair, </p>

<p>With painted faces and carved hairpins, </p>

<p>Fragile and full of grace, </p>

<p>Lithe and supple, </p>

<p>Of delicate feature and form, </p>

<p>Trailing cloaks of sheerest silk </p>

<p>And long robes that seem as though carved and painted, </p>

<p>Swirling and fluttering about them </p>

<p>Like magic garments; </p>

<p>With them wafts a cloud of scent, </p>

<p>A delicious perfume; </p>

<p>White teeth sparkle </p>

<p>In engaging smiles, </p>

<p>Eyebrows arch delicately, </p>

<p>Eyes cast darting glances, </p>

<p>Until their beauty has seized the soul
of the beholder </p>

<p>And his heart in joy hastens to their side. </p>

<p>"But then, when the wine has flowed freely and the
merriment is at its height, the Son of Heaven becomes lost in contemplation,
like one whose spirit has wandered, and he cries, 'Alas! What is this but a
wasteful extravagance? Now that I have found
> a moment of leisure from the
affairs of state, I thought it a shame to cast away the days in idleness and
so, in this autumn season, when Heaven itself slays life, I have joined in its
slaughter and come to this hunting park to take my ease. And yet I fear that those
who follow me in
ages to come may
grow infatuated with these sports,
until they
> lose themselves in the pursuit of
pleasure and forget to return again to their duties. Surely this is no way for
one who has inherited the throne to carry on the great task of his forbears and
insure the rule of our imperial house!' </p>

<p>"Then he dismisses the revellers, sends away the huntsmen,
and instructs his ministers, saying, 'If there are lands here in these suburbs
that can be opened for cultivation, let them all be turned into farms in order
that my people may receive aid and benefit thereby. Tear down the walls and
fill up the moats, that the common folk may come and
profit from these hills and lowlands! Stock the lakes with fish and do not
prohibit men from taking them! Empty the palaces and towers, and let them no
longer be staffed! Open the storehouses and granaries to succour the poor and
starving and help those who are in want; pity the widower and widow, protect
the orphans and those without families! I would broadcast the name of virtue
and lessen punishments and fines; alter the measurements and statutes, change 
the colour of
the vestments, reform the calendar
and, with all men
> under heaven, make a new beginning!' </p>

<p>"Then, selecting an auspicious day and fasting in
preparation, </p>

<p>He dons his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_robe">
court robes</a> </p>

<p>And mounts the carriage of state, </p>

<p>With its flowery pennants flying </p>

<p>And its jade bells ringing. </p>

<p>He sports now in the Park of the Six Arts, </p>

<p>Races upon the Road of Benevolence and Righteousness, </p>

<p>And scans the Forest of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Annals">
Spring and Autumn Annals</a>. </p>

<p>His archery now is to the stately measures of 'The Fox Head' </p>

<p>And 'The Beast of Virtue’;</p>

<p>His prey is the Dance of the Black Cranes, </p>

<p>Casting the heavenly Cloud Net, </p>

<p>He snares the songs of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Poetry">Book
of Odes</a>, </p>

<p>Sighs over 'The Felling of the Sandalwood' </p>

<p>And delights in the ruler who 'shares his joy with all'.</p>

<p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>And wanders in the orchard of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_documents">Book
of Documents</a>. </p>

<p>He spreads the teachings of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching">Book of
Changes</a>, </p>

<p>Sets free the strange beasts penned in his park, </p>

<p>Ascends the Bright Hall, </p>

<p>And seats himself in the Temple of the Ancestors. </p>

<p>"Then may his ministers freely present before him their
proposals for the betterment of the empire, and within the four seas there is
no one who does not share in the 'spoils' of this new hunt.Then
is the empire filled with great joy; all men turn their faces toward the wind
of imperial virtue and harken
to its sound.
> As
> though
> borne upon
> a stream, they are transformed to
goodness; with shouts of gladness they set forth
> upon
> the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">Way</a>
> and journey to righteousness, so
> that
> harsh punishments are set aside and no
longer used. Finer is this ruler's virtue than
> that of the Three Sages of
antiquity, more plenteous his merits than those of the Five Emperors. When a
ruler has achieved such virtue, then may he enjoy himself at the hunt without
incurring blame. But to gallop from morn to night in
sunshine or rain, exhausting the spirit and tiring the
> body,
> wearing out the
> carriages
> and
horses, draining the
energies of the huntsmen and squandering the resources of the treasury; to
think only of one's own pleasure before sufficient benefits have been bestowed
upon others; to ignore the common people and neglect the government of the
nation, merely because one is greedy for a catch of pheasants and hares - this
no truly benevolent ruler would do! Thus, from what I can see, the kings of Qi
and Chu merit only pity. Though their domains are no more than a thousand li
square, their hunting parks occupy nine tenths of the area, so that the land
cannot be cleared and the people have no space to grow food. When one who is no
more than a feudal prince attempts to indulge in
> extravagances fit only for the
supreme ruler, then I fear it is the common people who will suffer in the
end!" </p>

<p>At these words Sir Fantasy and Master No-such abruptly changed
countenance and looked uneasily about, quite at a loss for words. Then, backing
off and rising from their places, they replied, "We are uncouth and
ignorant men who do not know when to hold our tongues.Fortunately
today we have received your instruction, and we shall do our best to abide by
it." </p>
