            <p>I don&#8217;t know if he wants to be named, but my housemate made <a href="http://gradpay.org/">gradpay.org</a> where people can learn and share what institutions provide the best support for their grad students.</p>
            <p><a href="http://zbabb.com/">Zach Babb</a> started an organization at my school to <a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2011/12/defenders-of-the-universe-adversaries-of-the-ordinary/">build cool stuff</a>, designed a mobile ticketing app for my town&#8217;s transit system, and has helped me understand completely every physics question I&#8217;ve asked of him. He is a natural <a href="http://zbabb.com/blog/tutorial-0-getting-set-up/">teacher</a> and profoundly generous.</p>
            <p><a href="http://annelysegelman.com/">Annelyse Gelman</a> is one of the most inspiring people I know: artist, scientist, and deeply engaged human. I love her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/runthecops">photography</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shoulderblades">music</a>, <a href="http://annelysegelman.com/poetry">poetry</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/runthecops/5642360377/in/photostream/">self</a>.</p>

            <p>Rose Lewis is an artist in many media: <a href="http://audensmotel.blogspot.com">photography and writing</a>, <a href="http://audensmotel.blogspot.com/2013/03/blog-post_21.html">ink</a>, <a href="http://audensmotel.blogspot.com/2012/05/recent-work.html">paint</a>, <a href="http://sadlibrarian.bandcamp.com/">music</a>, and <a href="http://audensmotel.blogspot.com/2013/08/cat-princess.html">cats</a>.

            <p>Jen Polachek is eclectic and tough, and her interests -- from yoga to photography to food to art -- converge on a perspective on people and their relationships to their bodies that I find deeply humbling, and that guides my own self-care. Though it no longer quite accords with how she wants to write, she had for a while a beautiful <a href="http://www.happinessisaporkbun.com/">food blog</a> I still visit for ideas.</p>
            <p><a href="http://ariannarebolini.tumblr.com/">Arianna Rebolini</a> is my favorite non-fiction writer. She transformed how I think about television as a medium (if ever she writes a piece on this I will link it here) and taught me the value of accepting people as they are. You should read her pieces on <a href="http://thehairpin.com/tag/arianna-rebolini/">The Hairpin</a> for a brief idea of how wise and funny she is.</p>
            <p><a href="http://jeannieyoon.tumblr.com/">Jeannie Yoon</a> is a linguistics major and a fierce woman. Her facility with language has such fine resolution her prose is lyrical and her poetry is cogent. She makes delicious kimchi.</p>

            <p>I'm learning web development. I work for a non-profit that develops solely F/OSS, which means that in addition to the usual HTML/CSS/JS, I'm also learning Python. My next project is to learn Flask. The most exciting tools I've used so far have been <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a>, <a href="http://doughellmann.com/category/virtualenvwrapper">virtualenvwrapper</a>, and of course <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">Git</a>.

            <p>I take MOOCs through Coursera and EdX: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/digitaldemocracy">Securing Digital Democracy</a>, <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.00.1x/3T2013/">6.00.1x | Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</a>, and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/db">Introduction to Databases</a>. My favorite class has been <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/bigbang">From the Big Bang to Dark Energy</a>, the lectures of which I have <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wk3dx8c82owx405/npyKrcdqxU/From%20the%20Big%20Bang%20to%20Dark%20Energy">downloaded for sharing</a>.</p>
            like to learn JS at least well enough to use <a href="alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/">d3</a>.</p>
            <p>I update it somewhat sporadically, but I keep track of what I'm reading with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/meli-lewis">Goodreads</a>.</p>

            <p>I work for a non-profit that develops F/OSS to facilitate open scientific practices.</p>
            <p>I graduated from Reed College in 2013 and am preparing to apply to information school PhD programs.</p>
            <p>I like CrossFit and weightlifting generally, but I still can't do a pull-up.</p>
